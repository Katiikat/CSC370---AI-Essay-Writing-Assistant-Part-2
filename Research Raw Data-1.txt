		*** Content ***
Cube World is an action role-playing game developed and published by Picroma for Microsoft Windows. Wolfram von Funck, the game's designer, began developing the game in June 2011, and was later joined by his wife, Sarah. An alpha version of the game was released in July 2013, but saw sparse updates and communication from von Funck, with many considering the game to be vaporware until he officially released it on September 30, 2019.


== Gameplay ==

In Cube World, the player explores a large voxel-based world. It contains dungeons, including caverns and overworld castles, as well as biomes including grasslands, snowlands, deserts, and oceans. Players can use items such as hang gliders and boats to traverse the world more quickly.The game features character creation, which involves the player first choosing a race and sex, then customising the look of the character. The player then chooses one of four classes: warrior, rogue, ranger, or mage, each of which have access to unique armour, weapons, and abilities. The world is populated with monsters and creatures that can be killed for better armor and weapons, which results in stronger stats and abilities and allows players to choose specializations which best suit their playstyle, such as warriors being able to choose between focusing on damage or defensive abilities, or mages focusing on damage or healing abilities. Players can also tame animals, such as sheep or turtles, which fight alongside them, or, in some cases, can be ridden to traverse the world more quickly. Crafting is also a part of the game; it allows players to create food, potions, weapons, and armor, as well as cosmetics.


== Development ==
Cube World began development in June 2011, with designer Wolfram von Funck describing it as a 3D voxel-based game with a focus on exploration and role-playing game elements, citing games such as The Legend of Zelda, Secret of Mana, and World of Warcraft as inspiration. He was later joined by his wife, Sarah von Funck, who contributed the game's sprites and assisted in implementing new content. In January 2012, it was erroneously reported that Minecraft's developer Mojang had hired von Funck to help support him in developing Cube World.An alpha version of Cube World was first released on Picroma's website on July 2, 2013, but was eventually made unable to be repurchased. At the time, the game's download server suffered a DDoS attack, which von Funck later admitted was an unexpected event that "traumatized" him. During its alpha release, many players were concerned about further development of the game due to the general lack of updates from von Funck, with many considering the game to be vaporware, despite him stating several times during development that the game was still being worked on. In September 2019, von Funck announced that the game would be officially released via Steam on September 30, and that purchasers of the alpha release would receive a Steam key for free.


== Reception ==
The game has been criticized for its region-based progression system and balancing issues. James Davenport of PC Gamer criticized the repetitiveness of the game, calling it "shallow" and "boring". Luke Plunkett of Kotaku wrote that although the world was "very pretty", it is "badly in need of a tutorial" and "somehow worse than its alpha". Some reviewers commented that the game could not live up to fans' expectations after an extended wait.

		*** U.B. FUNKEYS ***
__________________________________________________

		*** Content ***
U.B. Funkeys is a personal computer game and collectible figure set created by Mattel. It was created in 2007 until discontinuation of the toys in the United States in 2010. Play consisted of a personal computer game that worked together with collectible figures that represent characters in the game. There are over 45 different "species" of Funkeys. Most Funkeys come in three different types of styles which are normal, rare, and very rare.
Gameplay involves players placing figures in the hub, (A special USB unit shaped to look like a larger version of the small figures) which in turn appear in the game. Each figure, when connected to the hub, allows players to unlock new areas of the game. The hub is purchased in a starter pack with two of the collectible figures. It is required to play the game. It began in August, 2007 and ended in January, 2010. The product was exhibited by Mattel in February 2007 at the American International Toy Fair and designed by Radica Games. The game software was developed by Arkadium.


== Description ==
Funkeys are characters that inhabit a virtual world called Terrapinia. Players navigate a number of zones and portals where they play games to earn coins. With their coins they can buy items to decorate their homes, referred to as "cribs" in the game.Users progress through the game as they collect different figures. Each "tribe" is able to access different areas, games and items. Most figures have two sets of alternate colors, and using these "Rare" or "Very Rare" Funkeys gives the player access to more items inside of their respective shops.
There are many portals to go through: Kelpy Basin, Magma Gorge, Laputta Station, Funkiki Island, Daydream Oasis, Nightmare Rift, Royalton Raceway, Hidden Realm, and Paradox Green. In order to use a portal, the player had to use a Funkey with a game room in the given location. For example, Sol can access Funkiki Island because its game room, "Relaxation Resort," is located there. However, Sol cannot access Lapuatta Station because there is no game room there it can access. Regardless of tribe, any Funkey can return to Funkeystown.*
In every zone, there is an enemy character who appears if the player stays outside for too long. These are: Henchmen in Funkeystown, Magma Gorge, Lapuatta Station, and Kelpy Basin; Natives on Funkiki Island; Dali in Daydream Oasis; Goya in Nightmare Rift; Kane in the Hidden Realm; and the Henchmen 2.0 in Paradox Green. Encountering these characters will start a short minigame where the player can win or lose coins.
Throughout the game, the player hears of Master Lox, the main antagonist of the series. He locked the portals and game rooms, restricting access only for particular Funkeys. In addition, he created the Henchmen to steal coins in Funkeystown, Kelpy Basin, Magma Gorge, and Laputta Station and the Henchman 2.0 in Paradox Green to destroy the Gnomon Tree. He also appears to be served by Dali and Goya.
There was also a series of Wendy's Kids meal toys. Some of them include a Bobblehead, A backpack clip, A 3D board game and 2 CDs that have prototypes of the game.

Exceptions: Jerry, Native, Pineapple King.


== Sets ==
The series spawned many various sets, which were available throughout the series' lifespan. These were single Funkeys, starter packs, adventure packs, Multiplayer sets, chat sets, and limited edition packs.


=== Starter Packs ===
Starter packs contain a white hub, installation disk, and instruction booklet. In general, each contained two to four funkeys relating to a particular world. The white hub design would change in some packs to reflect the new worlds. For instance, hubs made during the Dream State run have a chest with purple wisps on them.


=== Adventure Packs ===
During the series' lifespan, there were a number of adventure packs released. These contained several Funkeys from the same world that were of the same rarity. (i.e. all four would be Normal/Rare/Very Rare) Sometimes these Funkeys would be bundled together in starter packs, as well.


=== Chat/Multiplayer Packs ===
Several games from the Dream States and on offer multiplayer functionalities. These Funkeys would be bundled with one extra Funkey as a minor bonus (like adventure packs, both Funkeys are of the same rarity). Similarly, Chat Funkeys (who offer a chat room in place of a game) are bundled in with a bonus Funkey. Since all chat Funkeys are of Normal rarity, the bundled Funkey is, as well.


=== Limited Edition Packs ===
Limited edition packs were created that came with Funkeys that the player could not normally use. This included the Funkeystown adventure pack, and the Funkiki Island pack. A Dream State pack was also in coming, but was never officially released. 
The Funkeystown pack came with a Henchmen figure, a Master Lox figure, and the Mayor Sayso figure. Lox and the Henchman offered access to the Villain's Den, a shop-less game room in Funkeystown with a coin-related game. Mayor Sayso was able to access any game room in the original game, but cannot play any of the games.
The Funkiki Island pack came with Jerry, a Funkiki native, and the Pineapple King, along with a Normal Sol figure. In a similar fashion to the Funkeystown Adventure Pack, Jerry can access any game room but cannot play games, and the Native and Pineapple King can access the Funkiki Native Outpost.

		*** SKYLANDERS ***
__________________________________________________

		*** Content ***
Skylanders is a toys-to-life action-adventure video game series published by Activision. Inspired by the Spyro series, Skylanders games are played by placing character figures called the Skylanders on the "Portal of Power", a device that reads the figures' tags through NFC and "imports" the character represented by the figure into the game as a playable character.


== Plot ==
The game takes place in a world called "Skylands", a realm filled with adventure and floating islands. It is the center of the universe where it is constantly threatened by evil forces who seek to rule Skylands and gain access to all worlds. A band of heroes called the Skylanders use their abilities and machinery to defend their world from various threats, which they have done for generations. They have worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in Skylands, battling the forces of evil, and protecting the Core of Light. Kaos, the main antagonist, has destroyed the Core of Light and Skylands is in his hands. It is up to the player to send the Skylanders into the game and stop Kaos. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly. Each Skylander is associated with one of the ten elements of Skylands: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, and Dark. The main plot is the Skylanders going through levels to defeat Kaos, and stop him from ruling over Skylands. The console versions of each game follow identical storylines, while the Nintendo 3DS versions follow stories different from those of the console versions.


== Games ==


=== Spyro's Adventure (2011) ===

This is the first edition of the Skylanders franchise. There are 32 Skylanders in the game, and each has one of eight elements assigned to them, which allows them to open element-specific gates that are found throughout. 


=== Giants (2012) ===

Giants is the second installment in the Skylanders series set as a direct sequel to Spyro's Adventure. It introduces a new team of Skylanders called the Giants, massive creatures who were the first Skylanders assembled to stop the reign of Arkeyans. Unlike the other Skylanders, the Giants can lift, throw, and destroy trees as well as walking over things that may contain lions. The players use the Giants when Kaos has found a way to reactivate the Arkeyan Conquertron.


=== Swap Force (2013) ===

Swap Force is the third installment in the franchise. Taking place in another part of Skylands called the Cloudbreak Islands, the player takes control of a new group of Skylanders called the Swap Force who hold the ability to swap top and bottom halves and abilities. Together, the Swap Force and the Skylanders fight Kaos and his mother Kaossandra.


=== Trap Team (2014) ===

Trap Team is the fourth installment in the franchise. It introduces the Trap mechanic, which allows players to trap in-game enemies in element-specific Elemental Traps which are shards of trap crystals called traptainium. The trapped enemies can then be summoned as playable characters for a limited time, except in the main hub, where they can be played for an unlimited amount of time. They also introduced two new elements, those being the Light and Dark elements.


=== SuperChargers (2015) ===

SuperChargers is the fifth installment in the series. It introduces a new group of Skylanders called the SuperChargers who pilot special vehicles that allow the Skylanders to create rifts to travel through like portals. Two characters included on the Nintendo console versions are Mario franchise characters Donkey Kong as Turbo Charge Donkey Kong and Bowser as Hammer Slam Bowser. The pair and their vehicles(Barrel Blaster(Donkey Kong's) and Clown Cruiser(Bowser's)) are only playable on Nintendo consoles. The characters, but not their vehicles, which were made exclusively for the game, also function as amiibo figures. The Wii version of the game is titled Skylanders: Superchargers Racing and does not have adventure segments from the Wii U and PS3 versions. The Nintendo 3DS version also carries that same name and likewise focuses on the racing elements only. This was the last game to be released on tablets.


=== Imaginators (2016) ===

A sixth game was released on October 16, 2016 in North America, October 14, 2016 in Europe, and October 13, 2016 in Australia and New Zealand. In June 2016, Activision announced that the game would be titled Skylanders Imaginators, which allows players to create and customize their own Skylanders called Imaginators. The title was developed by Toys for Bob. Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex are guest stars as playable characters in the game, marking their first appearance in a video game since Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 2 in 2010. They are exclusive to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 starter packs, but are playable on all consoles. Crash and Cortex appear as part of the Sensei Skylanders whose job is to train the Imaginators.


=== Spin-offs ===
Activision released seven Skylanders spin-off games on mobile devices. These titles include Cloud Patrol, Battlegrounds, Lost Islands, Collection Vault, Trap Team / SuperChargers (mobile port), Battlecast and Ring of Heroes.


== Music ==
Lorne Balfe has composed the soundtracks to all the Skylanders games thus far, while Hans Zimmer composed the main theme.


== Media ==


=== Novels ===
A series of books in the Skylanders franchise started with Skylanders: The Machine of Doom that takes place before the events of Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure. It was written by Cavan Scott, who would later write sequels to the novel under the Skylanders: The Mask of Power series, which also serve as prequels to Spyro's Adventure.


=== IDW Publishing ===
IDW Publishing created a comic series associated with the Skylanders franchise that has events that take place in between the games.


=== TV series ===

In 2015, it was announced that Activision Blizzard Studios would produce an animated television series based on Skylanders. The first season debuted on Netflix on October 28, 2016, the second season on October 6, 2017 and the third and final season premiered on September 28, 2018. On April 30, 2019, it was announced that Skylanders Academy was cancelled.


=== Possible film ===
Activision has commented on the possibility of a movie and TV series based on the Skylanders reboot as something that they could look into in the future. On May 6, 2014, Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg announced that the Activision team had an interest in "jumping on the film adaptation bandwagon" and adapting Skylanders into a film.
